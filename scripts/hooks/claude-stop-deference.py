"""Claude Code Stop hook: catch a seat ending its turn on deference or waiting.

The pattern this targets recurs across custodian seats despite feedback
memories recording it (third and fourth occurrences, 2026-11-03 and 11-04):
ending a turn by handing Tony a veto ("unless you'd rather...", "if you don't
object by..."), or ending on a promise or a wait ("next I'll...", "waiting for
the notification"). Memories teach what not to say; this runs outside the
model, at the moment it happens.

On a match it blocks the stop once, with a reason, so the seat reconsiders.
If the seat stops again (stop_hook_active), the stop is allowed: some
questions genuinely belong to Tony (keys, hardware, his own choices).

Every catch is appended to logs/stop-hook-catches.jsonl, including the
second, allowed stop, so false positives and real catches can be counted.
